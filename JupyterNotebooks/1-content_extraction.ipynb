      "(f) Phaseout of marriage penalty in 15-percent bracket; adjustments in tax tables so that inflation will not result in tax increases (1) In general Not later than December 15 of 1993, and each subsequent calendar year, the Secretary shall prescribe tables which shall apply in lieu of the tables contained in subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) with respect to taxable years beginning in the succeeding calendar year. (2) Method of prescribing tables The table which under paragraph (1) is to apply in lieu of the table contained in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e), as the case may be, with respect to taxable years beginning in any calendar year shall be prescribed (A) except as provided in paragraph (8), by increasing the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket for which a tax is imposed under such table by the cost-of-living adjustment for such calendar year, (B) by not changing the rate applicable to any rate bracket as adjusted under subparagraph (A), and (C) by adjusting the amounts setting forth the tax to the extent necessary to reflect the adjustments in the rate brackets. (3) Cost-of-living adjustment For purposes of paragraph (2), the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1992. (4) CPI for any calendar year For purposes of paragraph (3), the CPI for any calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of such calendar year. (5) Consumer Price Index For purposes of paragraph (4), the term Consumer Price Index means the last Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the revision of the Consumer Price Index which is most consistent with the Consumer Price Index for calendar year 1986 shall be used. (6) Rounding (A) In general If any increase determined under paragraph (2)(A), section 63(c)(4), section 68(b)(2) or section 151(d)(4) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50. (B) Table for married individuals filing separately In the case of a married individual filing a separate return, subparagraph (A) (other than with respect to sections 63(c)(4) and 151(d)(4)(A)) shall be applied by substituting $25 for $50 each place it appears. (7) Special rule for certain brackets In prescribing tables under paragraph (1) which apply to taxable years beginning in a calendar year after 1994, the cost-of-living adjustment used in making adjustments to the dollar amounts at which the 36 percent rate bracket begins or at which the 39.6 percent rate bracket begins shall be determined under paragraph (3) by substituting 1993 for 1992. (8) Elimination of marriage penalty in 15-percent bracket With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003 , in prescribing the tables under paragraph (1) (A) the maximum taxable income in the 15-percent rate bracket in the table contained in subsection (a) (and the minimum taxable income in the next higher taxable income bracket in such table) shall be 200 percent of the maximum taxable income in the 15-percent rate bracket in the table contained in subsection (c) (after any other adjustment under this subsection), and (B) the comparable taxable income amounts in the table contained in subsection (d) shall be ½ of the amounts determined under subparagraph (A).\n",

      "Subsection# 6: Certain unearned income of children taxed as if parents income\n",
      "(g) Certain unearned income of children taxed as if parents income (1) In general In the case of any child to whom this subsection applies, the tax imposed by this section shall be equal to the greater of (A) the tax imposed by this section without regard to this subsection, or (B) the sum of (i) the tax which would be imposed by this section if the taxable income of such child for the taxable year were reduced by the net unearned income of such child, plus (ii) such childs share of the allocable parental tax. (2) Child to whom subsection applies This subsection shall apply to any child for any taxable year if (A) such child (i) has not attained age 18 before the close of the taxable year, or (ii) (I) has attained age 18 before the close of the taxable year and meets the age requirements of section 152(c)(3) (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) thereof), and (II) whose earned income (as defined in section 911(d)(2)) for such taxable year does not exceed one-half of the amount of the individuals support (within the meaning of section 152(c)(1)(D) after the application of section 152(f)(5) (without regard to subparagraph (A) thereof)) for such taxable year, (B) either parent of such child is alive at the close of the taxable year, and (C) such child does not file a joint return for the taxable year. (3) Allocable parental tax For purposes of this subsection (A) In general The term allocable parental tax means the excess of (i) the tax which would be imposed by this section on the parents taxable income if such income included the net unearned income of all children of the parent to whom this subsection applies, over (ii) the tax imposed by this section on the parent without regard to this subsection. For purposes of clause (i), net unearned income of all children of the parent shall not be taken into account in computing any exclusion, deduction, or credit of the parent. (B) Childs share A childs share of any allocable parental tax of a parent shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to the total allocable parental tax as the childs net unearned income bears to the aggregate net unearned income of all children of such parent to whom this subsection applies. (C) Special rule where parent has different taxable year Except as provided in regulations, if the parent does not have the same taxable year as the child, the allocable parental tax shall be determined on the basis of the taxable year of the parent ending in the childs taxable year. (4) Net unearned income For purposes of this subsection (A) In general The term net unearned income means the excess of (i) the portion of the adjusted gross income for the taxable year which is not attributable to earned income (as defined in section 911(d)(2)), over (ii) the sum of (I) the amount in effect for the taxable year under section 63(c)(5)(A) (relating to limitation on standard deduction in the case of certain dependents), plus (II) the greater of the amount described in subclause (I) or, if the child itemizes his deductions for the taxable year, the amount of the itemized deductions allowed by this chapter for the taxable year which are directly connected with the production of the portion of adjusted gross income referred to in clause (i). (B) Limitation based on taxable income The amount of the net unearned income for any taxable year shall not exceed the individuals taxable income for such taxable year. (C) Treatment of distributions from qualified disability trusts For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any child who is a beneficiary of a qualified disability trust (as defined in section 642(b)(2)(C)(ii)), any amount included in the income of such child under sections 652 and 662 during a taxable year shall be considered earned income of such child for such taxable year. (5) Special rules for determining parent to whom subsection applies For purposes of this subsection, the parent whose taxable income shall be taken into account shall be (A) in the case of parents who are not married (within the meaning of section 7703), the custodial parent (within the meaning of section 152(e)) of the child, and (B) in the case of married individuals filing separately, the individual with the greater taxable income. (6) Providing of parents TIN The parent of any child to whom this subsection applies for any taxable year shall provide the TIN of such parent to such child and such child shall include such TIN on the childs return of tax imposed by this section for such taxable year.
