(2) Method of prescribing tables The table which under paragraph (1) is to apply in lieu of the table contained in subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e), as the case may be, with respect to taxable years beginning in any calendar year shall be prescribed (A) except as provided in paragraph (8), by increasing the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket for which a tax is imposed under such table by the cost-of-living adjustment for such calendar year, (B) by not changing the rate applicable to any rate bracket as adjusted under subparagraph (A), and (C) by adjusting the amounts setting forth the tax to the extent necessary to reflect the adjustments in the rate brackets. (3) Cost-of-living adjustment For purposes of paragraph (2), the cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1992. (4) CPI for any calendar year For purposes of paragraph (3), the CPI for any calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of such calendar year. (5) Consumer Price Index For purposes of paragraph (4), the term Consumer Price Index means the last Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the revision of the Consumer Price Index which is most consistent with the Consumer Price Index for calendar year 1986 shall be used. (6) Rounding (A) In general If any increase determined under paragraph (2)(A), section 63(c)(4), section 68(b)(2) or section 151(d)(4) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50. (B) Table for married individuals filing separately In the case of a married individual filing a separate return, subparagraph (A) (other than with respect to sections 63(c)(4) and 151(d)(4)(A)) shall be applied by substituting $25 for $50 each place it appears. (7) Special rule for certain brackets In prescribing tables under paragraph (1) which apply to taxable years beginning in a calendar year after 1994, the cost-of-living adjustment used in making adjustments to the dollar amounts at which the 36 percent rate bracket begins or at which the 39.6 percent rate bracket begins shall be determined under paragraph (3) by substituting 1993 for 1992. (8) Elimination of marriage penalty in 15-percent bracket With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003 , in prescribing the tables under paragraph (1) (A) the maximum taxable income in the 15-percent rate bracket in the table contained in subsection (a) (and the minimum taxable income in the next higher taxable income bracket in such table) shall be 200 percent of the maximum taxable income in the 15-percent rate bracket in the table contained in subsection (c) (after any other adjustment under this subsection), and (B) the comparable taxable income amounts in the table contained in subsection (d) shall be \\xc2\\xbd of the amounts determined under subparagraph (A).'\n",
